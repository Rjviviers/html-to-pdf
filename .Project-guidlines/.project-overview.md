Project Overview: High-Performance HTML-to-PDF Converter
This document provides a high-level overview of the proposed solution for creating a fast, cross-platform application that converts large batches of HTML files into bookmarked PDF documents.

1. Project Goal
The primary objective is to develop a desktop application for Windows and Linux that efficiently converts large volumes of multi-page HTML files into high-quality PDF documents. The application must be fast, handle batch processing, automatically generate PDF bookmarks from HTML headings, and feature a simple user interface to display conversion progress.

2. Recommended Technology Stack (Stack A)
After a thorough analysis, the recommended technology stack consists of three core components:

Conversion Engine: WeasyPrint

A powerful, open-source Python library specifically designed for converting web documents into print-ready PDFs. Its key advantage is the native, out-of-the-box ability to automatically create a hierarchical bookmark structure in the PDF from the HTML heading tags (   

<h1>, <h2>, etc.). This directly fulfills a critical project requirement without needing complex workarounds.   

Backend Logic: Python

A mature and robust programming language that will serve as the application's "engine room." Python's multiprocessing module is perfectly suited for CPU-intensive tasks like PDF conversion, as it enables true parallel processing across multiple CPU cores, dramatically speeding up large batch jobs.   

User Interface (UI) Framework: Tauri

A modern framework for building lightweight and secure desktop applications using web technologies. Unlike alternatives, Tauri leverages the operating system's native web renderer, resulting in significantly smaller application sizes (as low as 3-10 MB) and lower memory consumption. This aligns perfectly with the requirement for a "small user interface" and ensures the application feels fast and responsive.   

3. How It Works: A Simplified Workflow
User Interaction: The user opens the application and is presented with a clean, simple interface for selecting a folder of HTML files.

Job Submission: Upon clicking "Convert," the UI sends the list of files to the Python backend, which runs seamlessly in the background.

Parallel Processing: The Python backend creates a queue of conversion jobs. A pool of worker processes, one for each available CPU core, picks up jobs from the queue and executes them simultaneously.   

Conversion & Bookmarking: Each worker process uses the WeasyPrint engine to render an HTML file into a PDF. During this process, WeasyPrint automatically scans the HTML for heading tags and builds the corresponding bookmarks in the final PDF.   

Real-Time Feedback: As each file is converted, the worker process notifies the UI, which updates a progress bar in real-time, giving the user clear feedback on the status of the batch job.   

Completion: Once all files are processed, the user has a complete set of high-quality, bookmarked PDFs in their designated output folder.

4. Key Benefits of This Approach
Efficiency: Directly meets all project requirements with a cohesive and elegant architecture.

Performance: Leverages true parallelism to process large batches as quickly as modern hardware allows.

Quality: Produces high-fidelity PDFs with automatic, accurate bookmarking.

User Experience: The application is lightweight, fast to launch, and provides a responsive interface with clear progress indicators.

Maintainability: The clear separation between the UI and the backend logic makes the application easier to develop, test, and maintain.
